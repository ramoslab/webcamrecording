# Steps for installing building the most recent version of the webcam recording system

(Steps to be taken only once)
a) Clone repository into /home/tecnalia/code/video
b) Create symbolic link to the CMakeLists_SYSTEM.txt: e.g.: 
    cd build
    ln -s CMakeLists_debian.txt CMakeLists.txt
c) Create symbolic link to the executable file of the webcam server (does not exist yet - will be created in the next step) from the root directory of the webcam files, e.g.: 
    cd build/executable
    ln -s webcam_server ../../webcam_server

(Steps to be taken each time a new version is available)
1. git pull or git fetch and git merge
2. Navigate to build directory
3. run cmake in the local directory ("."): cmake .
4. run make in the local directory: make

If everything works this will create a new file (or replace the old file) named "webcam_server" in the build/executable directory.

(only once)
After running the compilation the first time you need to allow the user to execute the file by typing:
    cd build/executable
    chmode u+x webcam_server

Now you should be able to run the webcam server from the root directory of the folder "webcamrecording"
